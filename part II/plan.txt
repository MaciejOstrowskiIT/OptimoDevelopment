My room renovation plan:
Before the main part of the work starts, the entire room should be groundly cleaned and emptied from all furniture. The next step afterward would be floor preparation.
I must cover the whole space before I can repaint the walls. The paint will be white for sure.
I need a bright space to work in there.
The next step will be screwing the shelf for my books and also hanging the monitor holder to save space on my desk.
My new desk is higher than the present one. Also, I bought a new ergonomic chair to improve my sitting position. Just need to twist them up.
After that, I have to remove the cover from the floor and set the furniture back.
When everything is in the right place – It’s time to plug in my computer, arrange the books and finally adjust the desk height to my sitting posture.
Last but not least – I need to hand the curtains to the windows so sunlight won’t bother me anymore.
Finally, I can add ambient light under my desk and monitors to protect my eyesight.
